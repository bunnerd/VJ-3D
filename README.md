This is a 3D platform game based on Cliffy Jump with some of our own ideas. We made it as a [university project](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/bachelors-degrees/bachelor-degree-informatics-engineering/curriculum/syllabus/VJ) with Unity.

There are two levels, _Sakura_ and _Ruins_, with 10 screens each. The player controls an animal that runs on a preset path and has to avoid the obstacles (mainly by jumping).

## Try the game

The game is intended to be played on PC, but since Cliffy Jump is a mobile game the controls are also compatible. Please mind that the mobile build can be buggy depending on the device and its existance is merely a coincidence. The game works best on PC.

See [Releases]() for both Windows and Android builds.

#### Controls

On PC, you can **jump** either with the spacebar or with the mouse left click. With these the player moves when stopped on a stop sign too. On Android, it's just tapping anywhere on the screen.

There are no more controls: use the buttons on the UI to navigate the game and figure out what is offers!
